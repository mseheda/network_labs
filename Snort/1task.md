# Snort Rule Report

## Overview
This report details the Snort rules provided for detecting malicious traffic patterns, specifically related to malware activities. Each rule has a clear purpose and is designed to identify indicators of compromise (IOCs) or behaviors associated with specific threats. Below is a description of each rule, its functionality, and the conditions under which it triggers.

---

## Rules

### 1. **NetSupport RAT HTTP POST Detected**
```snort
alert tcp any any -> 194.180.191.164 443 (msg:"NetSupport RAT HTTP POST detected"; flow:to_server,established; content:"POST"; http_method; content:"fakeurl.htm"; http_uri; sid:100001; rev:1;)
```
- **Purpose**: Detects traffic associated with the NetSupport RAT command-and-control (C2) server.
- **Trigger Condition**:
  - An HTTP POST request is sent to the IP address `194.180.191.164` on port 443.
  - The request contains the URI `fakeurl.htm`.
- **Explanation**:
  - NetSupport RAT uses this specific behavior to exfiltrate data or send instructions to compromised devices.
  - The rule ensures rapid detection of such activity to prevent further damage.

### 2. **SmartApeSG Domain Activity Detected**
```snort
alert tcp any any -> any 80 (msg:"SmartApeSG domain activity detected"; flow:to_server,established; content:"modandcrackedapk.com"; http_header; sid:100002; rev:1;)
```
- **Purpose**: Identifies traffic directed to the malicious domain `modandcrackedapk.com`.
- **Trigger Condition**:
  - Any HTTP request (port 80) containing the domain name `modandcrackedapk.com` in the HTTP header.
- **Explanation**:
  - This domain is associated with malicious software distribution and phishing campaigns.
  - The rule ensures visibility into any attempts to communicate with or retrieve data from this domain.

---

### 3. **Potential Malicious Activity from Compromised Host**
```snort
alert ip 10.11.26.183 any -> any any (msg:"Potential malicious activity from compromised host"; sid:100003; rev:1;)
```
- **Purpose**: Monitors all outbound traffic from the suspected compromised host `10.11.26.183`.
- **Trigger Condition**:
  - Any IP traffic originating from `10.11.26.183`.
- **Explanation**:
  - This rule is useful for detecting unusual or unauthorized outbound traffic, such as data exfiltration or C2 communication, from a known compromised machine.

---

### 4. **Malicious File Download (Udate.js) Detected**
```snort
alert http any any -> any any (msg:"Malicious file download (Udate.js) detected"; flow:to_client,established; content:"Udate.js"; http_uri; sid:100004; rev:1;)
```
- **Purpose**: Detects downloads of a known malicious file named `Udate.js`.
- **Trigger Condition**:
  - An HTTP response (to a client) contains the URI `Udate.js`.
- **Explanation**:
  - This file is identified as part of a malware delivery mechanism. Detecting its download helps mitigate potential infection.
  - The rule specifically focuses on the URI to pinpoint downloads of this exact file.

---

### 5. **Suspicious HTTPS POST Request Detected**
```snort
alert tcp any any -> any 443 (msg:"Suspicious HTTPS POST request detected"; flow:to_server,established; content:"POST"; http_method; sid:100005; rev:1;)
```
- **Purpose**: Identifies potentially malicious HTTPS POST requests.
- **Trigger Condition**:
  - Any HTTPS POST request sent to a server on port 443.
- **Explanation**:
  - POST requests are commonly used in data exfiltration or for sending instructions to C2 servers. Monitoring these requests helps detect suspicious behavior in encrypted traffic.

---

## Why These Rules Are Usable

1. **Specific Targeting**:
   - Each rule is crafted based on unique IOCs or traffic patterns associated with known malware. For example, targeting a specific IP (`194.180.191.164`) ensures accuracy in detecting NetSupport RAT.

2. **Behavioral Detection**:
   - Rules like "Suspicious HTTPS POST request" focus on behavioral indicators, which are harder for attackers to evade compared to static indicators like IP addresses.

3. **Proactive Monitoring**:
   - The rules for monitoring compromised hosts (`10.11.26.183`) and malicious file downloads (`Udate.js`) provide proactive threat detection by identifying and blocking known malicious activities.

4. **Broad Coverage**:
   - These rules cover multiple layers of attack, from domain and IP-based detection to specific HTTP/HTTPS traffic patterns.

---

## When Each Rule Triggers

1. **NetSupport RAT Detection**:
   - Triggered when a POST request with `fakeurl.htm` is sent to the known C2 IP.

2. **SmartApeSG Domain Activity**:
   - Triggered when any communication with `modandcrackedapk.com` is detected in the HTTP header.

3. **Compromised Host Activity**:
   - Triggered by any outbound communication from the IP `10.11.26.183`, irrespective of the destination.

4. **Malicious File Download**:
   - Triggered when the URI `Udate.js` is detected in an HTTP response.

5. **Suspicious HTTPS POST**:
   - Triggered by any HTTPS POST request, indicating potential data exfiltration or malicious command exchange.

## Summary

The provided rules are essential for detecting malicious traffic patterns and potential threats. They combine precision (targeting specific IOCs) and generalization (monitoring unusual behavior), offering comprehensive network protection. By employing these rules, network operators can detect and mitigate threats effectively.
